# Welcome to _www-clear_ by CodeDay!

## Introduction

At **www-clear**, volunteers are able to mange events, see participant registration, manage ticket pricing, view event status, see a list of sponsors, edit notifications, and view related projects. Engineered with Next.js and React, this repo also incorporates design rules and display requirements defined within _topo_.

The following mind map illustrates how data flows from **www-clear** through **gql-server** to the **gql-clear** server and back to the user:
